# React Calendar

The React Calendar is intended to be an application that "mimics" some features of Google Calendar, like scheduling an event, editing / deleting the event, among others. Both the server and the Client are hosted in Heroku.

Developed under the MERN (MongoDB - Express - React - Node) stack, and implements two big projects, The Frontend Client Application, and the Backend Server. As this, the development of the Client and the Server is independent, and both "worlds" are connected via HTTP requests.
      
The application presents Authentication Feature with JWT, Database service using MongoDB and Mongo Atlas, for the Client Side, React.js with Redux to manage the applicationâ€™s global state, alongside with server requests.
